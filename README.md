Baseline CycleGAN implementation for photo-to-painting image translation. 

The baseline implementation is in BaselineGAN.ipynb. Cells in the notebook can be executed to import necessary dependencies, define the baseline model architecture and train using the initial data. Data used in BaselineGAN is located in the data folder in subdirectories trainA and trainB.
